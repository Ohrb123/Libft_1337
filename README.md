# Libft_1337
Welcome to the Libft project repository! This project is part of the curriculum at 1337 and serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of C programming and memory management.
# Overview
This project aims to make you code in C a library of usual functions that you will be able to use for your next projects.

# Project Description
In many 42 projects, the use of standard C library functions is prohibited. Therefore, the objective of this initial project is to recreate several common functions, along with some additional ones, on our own.

We will develop a library that can be utilized in our future projects.
